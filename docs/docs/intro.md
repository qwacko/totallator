# Overivew

Totallator is a self-hosted bookkeeping / accounting application. It is created to scratch a personal itch, it may be useful to others which is why it is released as open-source.

## Objectives

The key objectives of createing yet another accounting tool is the following:

- **Manual entry is a first class citizen** Other accounting options are focused on importing data or connecting to APIs. Manual entry being a first class citizen leads to items such as bulk editing, inline editing (table format). The intention is to support someone manually inputting 50-100 transactions a week without being a big drain on time.
- **Customisable Reporting (Incomplete)** If there is information stored in the system, then a user should be able to make it into a report / list that fits them. This funcionality is still to be implemented, however once implemented then a user should be able to create reports / graphs / etc.. that include any selection and subset of data.
- **Data Grouping** Provide options for someone to store a number of different metadata elements against transaction data. This supports the ability to report information easily.
- **Performant** Minimise page navigations for routine tasks, and ensure updates / loading is done in a way that feels as close as possible to a local app.
